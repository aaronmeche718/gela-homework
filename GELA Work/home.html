    Aaron Meche - 5th Hour
    <br>
    <br> In 5th hour, I created and presented a paper with drawings of symbols to represent different body parts of someone
    I interviewed. For example, the body part is the ear, you would ask them, ”What is something profound you have heard
    someone say about you that has influenced you?” Then, with that response, you would have to creatively come up with a
    symbol to represent their response. In my paper, I could have improved in many aspects. To start off, I could have given
    a more detailed explanation of the questions. Second, I could have given a more detail on my paper. I just gave a brief
    explanation of the subject’s response. Thirdly, I could have improved on the representation of the symbols. For example,
    I could have colored the pictures more, and made them more detailed. Also, I could have drawn the which was not enough.
    symbol on the body, and show how it relates in the drawing. Finally, I could have improved on making people realize what
    the drawing was before I explained. Overall, I could have improved on many aspects on the project, such as the detail,
    the explanation, drawings, coloring, and giving more detail to the interviewer.
